Taking advantage of the well-known [CSDIY](https://csdiy.wiki/) and Claude’s suggestions for my current situation, I’ve decided on my focus for the next couple of months.

*Order does not matter*

**Neetcode**: [https://neetcode.io/courses](https://neetcode.io/courses)

> Start with the basics. After finishing, review and practice through leetcode until reaching 150 solved. Next step go for advanced

**Networking**: [https://sp25.cs168.io/](https://sp25.cs168.io/)

> Networking is so important for infrastructure work. I realized this after working on mts-feed, which really exhausts me

**C++**: [https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/)

> You're an academism, learn by a course! Do all the homework!

**Docker**: [https://docker-curriculum.com/](https://docker-curriculum.com/)

> Second tutorial after Docker 101

**PostgreSQL**: [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/postgresql-for-everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/postgresql-for-everybody)

> This is very fundamental my friend, you MUST know it

**Redis**: [https://realpython.com/python-redis/](https://realpython.com/python-redis/)

> Some familiarity would be enough
