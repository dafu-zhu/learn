# Alpha miner

## Objectives

- Build my own alpha factory
- Get a consultant position in Worldquant brain
- Earn salary by submitting alphas
- Design a system to mine alpha automatically, put it on resume

## Definition of Done

- Mines 500+ alphas/hour
- Validates quality through 8-stage pipeline (10%+ pass rate)
- Acceptable on Worldquant brain
- Well documented
- Deploys to production via FastAPI + Docker + AWS

## Technical approaches

Use the finite operators given by worldquant, leverage genetic programming (GP) and reinforcement learning (RL) to improve miner efficiency. Open to alternative algorithms despite RL.
